You have to create a module named "utils.py" which will contain the following function:

dislok: take a string in parameter, and cut the chain to every space and return the result

sort_list: take a list in parameter and order it from the smaller element to the greater element then print it on the standart output the list will only contains int values

rev_it: a program which will take a list OR a string as parameter and will reverse it wether no matter the type is

hint: list, str, iterator, for in, order, isinstance, reversed
