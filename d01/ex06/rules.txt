Now you've done the last exercise I need a programm name "stalker.py" to output datas in an understandable format called json (https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html)

The program  will take 1 or 2 parameters if one you should print on the standart output the json formated document otherwise you'll have to create the file given as second parameter and write the json in it.

The program which will check your exercise need a 4 indent it's all yours to understand what it means ;)

for example:

    ./stalker.py mabite_j lol
    no such login known

All the datas written here are not the output needed the xxx are here to hide datas about people we won't help you gathering datas

=============

    $ ./stalker.py lol_k
    no such user

=============

    $ ./stalker.py minore_v
    datas collected
    {
	city-of-living: xxx,
	first-name: xxx,
	last-name: xxx,
	sur-name: xxx,
	last-name: xxx,
	age: xxx,
	skoker: xxx,
	born-date: xxx
    }

=============

    $ ./stalker.py lol_k pingou
    no such user
    $ cat pingou
    no such file or directory

=============

    $ ./stalker.py minore_v koala
    datas collected
    $ cat koala
    datas collected
    {
	city-of-living: xxx,
	first-name: xxx,
	last-name: xxx,
	sur-name: xxx,
	last-name: xxx,
	age: xxx,
	skoker: xxx,
	born-date: xxx
    }

Think about something: Is it important to have your datas ordered ?

hint: json (url above), open, with, file operation in python
