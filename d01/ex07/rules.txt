For this exercise I need you to parse a log file givem as parameter and to prettify his output or create a new file with particular option

if no parameters are given it will output on the satndart output each line but the severity level (explained later in the subject) will be colored
   INFO will be in green
   DEBUG will be in blue
   FATAL will be in red
   ALERT will be in yellow

for the colors we give you this class as his with no explication how to use it (enjoy =D)

class bcolors:
    HEADER = '\033[95m'
    OKBLUE = '\033[94m'
    OKGREEN = '\033[92m'
    WARNING = '\033[93m'
    FAIL = '\033[91m'
    ENDC = '\033[0m'

hint: what is a class ? =D

you'll have to handle multiple parameters which will be:
       -i name of the input file
       -w print only the lines containing the word passed through this option it won't match datas like level and date.
       -l print only line with the level defined through of this option
       -f output is redirected in a particular file given through this option


example of a log line

25/10/2015 [INFO] all your base are belong to us

the INFO word means the level
the 25/10/2015 is the date of the log
the "all your base are belong to us" is the log sentence (where the -w match)

have fun

hint: argparse, split, in, open, files operations ;)
