    Hello everyone, and welcome to this year's edition of the python rush.

    First of all, let it be clear that this rush is not mandatory, but should
be taken as training material. Most of our demonstrations during this year
will be made in C or in python, so it is important for you to understand this
language easily.

    At the end of it, you will receive a detailed log of which exercises you
succeeded, which ones you failed and why.

    The rush will last on two days, the first consists of a large amount of
exercises designed to make you understand the basic of python, the second
one will be solely focused on applying the concepts learnt in day 01.

    You will of course be corrected by an automatic program, which will _not_
stop at the first mistake. Which means that you don't have to do the 
exercises in any particular order, although we tried to keep them sorted by
ascending difficulty.

    It is expected that you keep an eye on this repository, as its content
may change during the rush.

    As always, for any question, come and see us on 
irc.rezosup.org#cq-toulouse and most important of all, have fun!


    Note: pep8 mandatory
